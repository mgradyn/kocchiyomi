# Project Documentation

1.	Sign In Page
 ![image](./images/1.png)
When the user first open the app, the sign in page will pop up. Here, the user can input the existing credentials in order to continue to another page. The user can input the email and password then click the sign in button. If the user doesn‚Äôt have an account yet, we‚Äôve also prepared a button to sign up from the sign in page.

 ![image](./images/2.png)
There is also validation steps in the login page so the user have to input the email in a proper email format and the password will also be censored into circles. But the user can click the eye button in the right side of the password box to see the words.

  ![image](./images/3.png)
If the login is successful, the user will be navigated to the library page and there will be a pop up saying the login is successful

2.	Sign Up Page
  ![image](./images/4.png)
If the user doesn‚Äôt have an account yet, then the user can make the account in this sign up page. The user will be asked to input some data as shown in the page, which are username, email, password and confirm password. After the data is input, the user can click the sign up button to register his/her account. Other than that, if it turns out that the user already have an account, we also provide a button to go back to the sign in page.
 
 ![image](./images/5.png)
The Sign Up Page also has some validation steps and error message in case the data input is not suitable with the provision as we can see in the picture above. 
 
  ![image](./images/6.png)
If the user still try to push the sign up button with all the error message, then the user will not be able to get in and instead, he/she will receive a pop up asking him/her to recheck the data.
 
 ![image](./images/7.png)
If the words in the ‚Äúpassword‚Äù box and ‚Äúconfirm password‚Äù box is different, then there will be a pop up notifying the user that the password does not match. 

  ![image](./images/8.jpg)
The pop up, as shown above, will be shown if there is an error

3.	Library Page
  ![image](./images/9.png)
When the user succeed in logging in, the user will be directed to the library page. The above image show how it will look like when the library is empty. The user can add mangas they like to the library to help the user to find those mangas easier. 
  ![image](./images/10.png)
The image above shows how it will look like when the user has added some manga to the library, as we can see, the manga cover will be shown and we can directly click on it to see the manga details in the Manga Info Page. 

4.	Manga Info Page
  ![image](./images/11.png)
The Manga Info Page will show the information of a certain manga. It will also give a heart button to put the manga in the library. The heart will be full white when it is added to the library and will be empty when it is not in the library yet. And below the information, we can see chapters. When we click one of the chapter, we will be able to read that chapter of the manga



5.	Read Manga Page
  ![image](./images/12.png)
On top of the page, there are the pages, so we can move to another page by clicking one of the number above. Other than that, user can also move to the next page by swiping to left or right. There‚Äôs also an underline below the number to show which page is the user in

6.	Browse Page
  ![image](./images/13.png)
If we navigate to the Browse Page, we will see lists of manga covers. User can scroll down to see more mangas and if the user click on one of the mangas, then it will be navigated to the Manga Info Page of that certain manga.

7.	Search Page
  ![image](./images/14.png)
In the search page, the user can type in the search bar to find a certain manga the user like.
  ![image](./images/15.png)
As shown in the image above, when the user type a certain keyword, mangas with corresponding keyword will pop up and the user can search from there. Then if the user want to change the keyword, the user can erase manually or simply click the x on the right side of the search bar to erase the whole keyword. 

8.	Bottom Navigation Bar
  ![image](./images/16.png)
With the bottom navigation bar, the user will be able to easily move tabs. The icon will be highlighted if the user is in that certain tab.
9.	Drawer
  ![image](./images/17.png)
  ![image](./images/18.png)
If we see in the top left corner of the page, we can see that there is a burger icon. When the user click the burger icon, the drawer will slide out showing the username of the user and the user‚Äôs email. Other than that, it will show the log out button to the user. When the log out button is pressed, the user will be navigated back to the sign in page.
